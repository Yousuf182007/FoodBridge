# FoodBridge Demo Site

A static, ready-to-run demo of the FoodBridge concept. No backend required â€” just open `index.html`.

## Run
1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Use **Donate** to list food, **Find** to claim, and **Track** to view status.

## Notes
- Data is stored in `localStorage` for demo purposes.
- Click **Use my GPS** to sort by distance (if you allow location).
- For a full stack version, connect the forms to an Express + MongoDB API and add Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.
